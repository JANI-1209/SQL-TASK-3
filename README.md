# 📘 SQL Internship Task 3 – SELECT Queries & Data Filtering


## 🔍 What I Did in Task 3

✅ Used `SELECT` queries to retrieve data  
✅ Applied filters using `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, and `LIKE`  
✅ Sorted results using `ORDER BY`  
✅ Used `JOIN` to connect multiple related tables  
✅ Counted and grouped results using `GROUP BY`
